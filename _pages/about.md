THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT (MAY 02, 2022).

I am currently a Research Scientist in the Division of Geological and Planetary Science at California Institute of Technology (CalTech), where I work in [John H. Seinfeld laboratory on atmospheric chemistry](http://seinfeldlab.che.caltech.edu/).

I have a broad interest in all kinds of phenomena related to aerosol physics and chemistry. Specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the development of methods and instruments to understand the formation of particulate matter in the atmosphere. Prior to joining CalTech, I obtained both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees on Environmental Science and Engineering from Fudan University in Shanghai. You can find more details about me from here.

My name in Chinese is 黄元龙. I grew up in Taizhou, Jiangsu, China. Since 15, I spent three years in Suzhou before going to Shanghai. I like to boulder, play ping pong, and run when I am not working. I enjoy the sunshine and good food in Southern California.
